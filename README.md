# project-4

Name: Jordan Woodard

Overview: This is a school project for a paper trading app that I made called "General Banks". The overall theme of the app is based on the military, and the general idea is that you as the user are a "soldier" who is "serving" in the "army" to "fight" a "war" in order to manage your finances.

Details: General Banks features a charting library known as "Matplotlib", which tracks stock data by using a chart.  Five pages make up the project in total.  However, only three of them (Home, Login, and Portfolio) are accessible, since the other two (Contact and Settings) are not.  The links used for page navigation are on the top right side of the navbar.  It is possible to move between the Home page and Login page by clicking the links.  As for the Portfolio page, you can go there from the Login page by pressing a button, and you can go back to the Login page by clicking a link on the Portfolio page.

Technologies: html, css, py

Improvements: spend more time understanding Python, use more Django features, try out more charting libraries
